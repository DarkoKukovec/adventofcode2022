# Advent of code 2022

This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges by using Rust and wasm.

## Setup

### Install Rust

You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Install wasm-pack

You can install wasm-pack using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

```bash
cargo install wasm-pack
```
